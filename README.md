# refunjs
A functional framework and toolkit for building web applications. Simple functions on top, Reactjs on the bottom.

Approach:
* Simple collection of functions that provide verbs (think commands or actions) for the various aspects of a SPA
* Functional in nature: no external data mutation, composition of small functions to build larger solutions
* ES6
* State swapping for rewind / ff
* more to come!
